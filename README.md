# Open IDE
This is an open source IDE that you can hack apart, use as a foundation, or practice with.

This is not a glorious, production-grade IDE, I simply wrote this because I was bored.

## Building
This is a Qt6 cmake project, so install the following (below is for linux, your OS may differ):
```
```
````
```
sudo apt-get install cmake qtcreator build-essential libgl1-mesa-dev qt6-base-dev qt6-tools-dev-tools
```

Then start up QtCreator and build/run!
